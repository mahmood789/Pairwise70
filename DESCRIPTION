Description: Collection of 501 pairwise meta-analysis datasets systematically extracted from
    521 Cochrane systematic reviews (CD000028 to CD016278). Each dataset includes
    study-level data with binary outcomes (events/totals) or continuous outcomes (mean/SD/N),
    along with metadata (study identifiers, comparison/outcome descriptions, review DOIs).
    Contains approximately 50,000+ individual randomized controlled trials across diverse
    medical specialties. Designed for meta-research, methodological studies, education,
    and software validation in meta-analysis. Includes 13 novel advanced pooling methods:
    V3 (MWM, SIT, ARP) and V4 (WRD, CBM, RBM, SWA, TAS, EVE, PVM, AEM, SPE, SMS)
    for robust meta-analysis with improved coverage, outlier handling, and bias correction.
