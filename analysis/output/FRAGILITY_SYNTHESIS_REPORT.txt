FRAGILITY OF COCHRANE META-ANALYSES: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-01-02 17:44:55

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Analysis of 4424 meta-analyses from 474 Cochrane
systematic reviews reveals substantial fragility in evidence synthesis.

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. PREVALENCE OF FRAGILITY
   - NA (NA%) direction-fragile
   - NA (NA%) significance-fragile
   - NA (NA%) clinically-fragile
   - Only 44% are fully robust

2. CRITICAL FINDING FOR SIGNIFICANT RESULTS
   - NA% of significant findings would lose significance
     if a single study were removed
   - This equals NA Cochrane conclusions

3. PREDICTIVE MODEL PERFORMANCE
   - AUC for direction fragility: 0.837
   - AUC for significance fragility: 0.773
   - Number of studies (k) is strongest protective factor

4. MINIMUM k THRESHOLDS
   - k >= 19 for <20% direction fragility
   - k >= 25 for <10% direction fragility
   - Recommendation: k >= 10 minimum for 'robust' conclusions

5. HETEROGENEITY INTERACTION
   - Low I2 (<25%): NA% significance fragile
   - High I2 (>75%): NA% significance fragile
   - Higher heterogeneity = higher significance fragility

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

For Systematic Reviewers:
- Report leave-one-out fragility as standard
- Flag conclusions based on <10 studies
- Use fragility-aware interpretation of borderline results

For Guideline Developers:
- Weight evidence by fragility status
- Require larger evidence bases for strong recommendations
- Consider fragility in GRADE assessments

For Methodologists:
- Develop robust pooling methods
- Create fragility-aware confidence intervals
- Integrate fragility into living review frameworks
