INFORMATION ADEQUACY INDEX (IAI) - METHODS SPECIFICATION
================================================================================

DEFINITIONS
-----------

1. PREMATURE CONCLUSION
   A meta-analysis that has reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)
   before accumulating adequate information, defined as Information
   Fraction (IF) < 1.0. Such conclusions may be subject to reversal
   upon accumulation of additional evidence.

2. INFORMATION FRACTION (IF)
   IF = Actual Total Sample Size / Optimal Information Size (OIS)

   Classification:
   - IF >= 1.0:  Adequate information
   - IF 0.5-1.0: Marginal information
   - IF 0.25-0.5: Inadequate information
   - IF < 0.25:  Critical information deficit

3. OPTIMAL INFORMATION SIZE (OIS)
   Sample size required to detect a clinically important effect (RRR=20%)
   with 80% power, adjusted for heterogeneity:

   OIS = D x (1 + I^2/(1-I^2))

4. INFORMATION ADEQUACY INDEX (IAI)
   Composite metric combining four components with empirically-derived weights:

   IAI = 0.20 x IF_component +
         0.15 x HAP_component +
         0.35 x SBS_component +
         0.30 x Stability_component

   Classification:
   - IAI >= 0.75: Adequate
   - IAI 0.50-0.75: Marginal
   - IAI 0.25-0.50: Inadequate
   - IAI < 0.25: Critical

WEIGHT DERIVATION
-----------------
Empirical weights derived via grid search optimization (n=192 combinations)
maximizing AUC for predicting conclusive meta-analysis status.

Validation:
- Optimization AUC: 0.988
- 5-fold CV AUC: 0.988 (SD: 0.005)
- Weight sensitivity: 3.0% maximum class change at +/-10%

STABILITY COMPONENT
-------------------
Approximated from:
- Number of studies (k): 40% weight
- Heterogeneity (1-I^2): 30% weight
- Z-score magnitude: 30% weight

Note: This approximation correlates r=0.973 with cumulative Z-score
stability in validation subset.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
- Meta-analyses analyzed: 492
- Adequate information (IF >= 1): 57.6%

PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS (two complementary definitions):

1. IF-based definition (IF < 1 among significant MAs):
   - Rate: 24.4% (95% CI: 18.9% - 30.6%)
   - Interpretation: MAs that reached significance without adequate sample size

2. IAI-based definition (Critical/Inadequate IAI among significant MAs):
   - Rate: 12.6% (95% CI: 8.2% - 16.8%)
   - Interpretation: MAs with poor overall evidence quality despite significance
   - External validation: HIGHLY CONCORDANT with Imberger et al. (2016): 14%
