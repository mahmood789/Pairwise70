EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Total meta-analyses analyzed: 492
Proportion with adequate information (IF >= 1): 57.6%
Proportion with critical information deficit (IF < 0.25): 17.9%

KEY FINDING:
Among statistically significant meta-analyses:
- 24.3% have inadequate information (IF < 1.0)
- These represent potential PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS

INFORMATION ADEQUACY INDEX (IAI) DISTRIBUTION:
- Adequate: 32.5%
- Marginal: 21.5%
- Inadequate: 30.7%
- Critical: 15.2%

IMPLICATIONS:
1. Many published meta-analyses conclude prematurely
2. High heterogeneity dramatically increases information requirements
3. Small meta-analyses (k < 5) are particularly vulnerable
4. Statistical significance ≠ adequate evidence

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Report information fraction alongside p-values
2. Use IAI to prioritize meta-analyses for updating
3. Consider sequential boundaries before concluding
4. Adjust for heterogeneity in power calculations
